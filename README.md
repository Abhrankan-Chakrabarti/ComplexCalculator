# Complex Number Operations

This repository contains implementations for complex number operations in both Python and C++.

## Python Implementation

The Python implementation is provided in the file `Complex.py`. It allows for various operations on complex numbers, including modulus, argument, conjugate, reciprocal, conversion between polar and rectangular forms, and basic arithmetic operations.

### Usage

To use the Python implementation, simply import the `Complex` class from `Complex.py` and create instances of complex numbers. You can then perform operations on these instances as needed.

## C++ Implementation

The C++ implementation is provided in the file `complex.cpp`. It offers similar functionality to the Python implementation, allowing for operations on complex numbers such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

### Usage

To use the C++ implementation, include the `complex.cpp` file in your C++ project and use the provided functions to perform operations on complex numbers.
